# CCMetagen

CCMetagen processes sequence alignments produced with [KMA](https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/kma), which implements the ConClave sorting scheme to achieve highly accurate read mappings. The pipeline is fast enough to use the whole NCBI nt collection as reference, facilitating the inclusion of understudied organisms, such as microbial eukaryotes, in metagenome surveys. CCMetagen produces ranked taxonomic results in user-friendly formats that are ready for publication or downstream statistical analyses.
